# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute! Here are some guidelines:

## Pull Request Process

- Remove install/build dependencies before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- Update the README.md for non-obvious changes (new environment variables, exposed ports, container parameters, etc).
- Explain your changes.
- Merge the PR if you have sign-off from 2 other developers. If you don't have merge permission, you can ask someone else to merge it for you.

## Issues & Requests

- For issues, add a clear description, steps to reproduce, expected behavior, actual behavior, and relevant screenshots or logs.
- For requests, don't submit something just for your use-case â€” make sure it's useful for others too.
- Use tags

## Code Standards

We use ESLint and Prettier for linting/formatting. Make sure both are running before pushing changes.

## Code of Conduct

We welcome contributions, opinions and feedback from everyone. That said, any behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.
