### Getting Started

- Go To http://market.local:3000 (See Hosts file instructions below)

### Deploying

1. merge to `main`
1. CD will automatically run migrations (even destructive ones! for now)

### Preview branches

NB preview builds use their own db, so it does not affect prod

1. Push any build to a branch that builds successfully
1. CD will automatically deploy a [preview build](https://vercel.com/marketdotdev/store/deployments?environment=preview)

### Local Development

Local Development Setup for Prisma with PostgreSQL

#### 1. Create User and Database in PostgreSQL

Run the following commands in your PostgreSQL terminal to set up the user and database:

```bash
CREATE USER gitwallet WITH PASSWORD 'gitwallet_dev' CREATEDB;
CREATE DATABASE gitwallet_dev OWNER gitwallet;
```

#### 2. Set up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in your project root and add the following line:

```env
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="postgresql://gitwallet:gitwallet_dev@localhost:5432/gitwallet_dev?schema=public"
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="postgresql://gitwallet:gitwallet_dev@localhost:5432/gitwallet_dev?schema=public"
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install necessary Node.js packages:

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 4. Load the Schema

Run Migrations
```bash
pnpm prisma migrate dev
```

Overwite your local dev database with the contents of `prisma.schema`.
```bash
pnpm prisma db push
```

#### 5. Seed tables with sample data

```bash
pnpm db:seed
```

#### 8. Run the server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This setup allows you to simulate the complete payment flow including Connect account events, subscription updates, and payment processing.
